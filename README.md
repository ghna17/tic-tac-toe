# tic-tac-toe
Challenge: Create a working digital version of the ultimate classic, Tic-Tac-Toe.

Requirements
1. The user plays against the computer.
2. The user goes first.
3. The computer may make random moves.
4. The board is displayed after every move.
5. Conditional iteration insures both the user and the computer select valid moves and that the game ends correctly.
6. The user is told whenever they win or lose and then the program quits. Optionally, you may use a while loop to let the user play again.

Take your code engine and extend its inputs and outputs using graphics.py. The user should have an updating Tic-Tac-Toe board displayed for them in a graphics window and be able to click in a box to select their move. (The GraphWin classâ€™s
getMouse() method will be critical for this.)
